## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The famouse quote: How to center a div. Today I learned that. Beside centering div, I also learned how to use em and rem units of css instead of px.

Code Snippets;


```css
body{
    background: #D5E1EF;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
 }
.container{  
    margin-top: 10em;
    width: 19em;
    text-align: center;
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
    padding: 0.5em;
    border-radius: 1em;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);
}
```

### Continued development

I am looking for learning flexbox in more proper way and also keen to learn Grid. Also I want to start building projects with React Js in comming days.


### Useful resources

- [CSS from W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - The W3School always help me in writing CSS. I recommend this if you are not feeling confident in css, you should definently stick with this site.
